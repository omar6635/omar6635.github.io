<h1 id="welcome-to-my-blog">Welcome to my blog!</h1>
<p>We’re glad you decided to visit us today!</p>
<div id="what-is-this" />

<h2 id="what-is-this-blog-and-who-is-it-for">What is this blog and who is it for?</h2>

<p>How does one go about learning the basics and fundamentals of forex as a complete beginner? How can i develop a winning forex algorithm that can bring me consistent profits when the market is liquid and keep me out when it’s dry as a desert? How do i take off the huge emotional load that trading puts on my shoulders? Is it even possible to make money in a market where more than 90% of the participants are either losing money, breaking even or barely getting by with tiny profit margins?</p>

<p>Every trader has asked themselves these questions at one point or another in their trading journey. Do you want answers and real talk? Are you tired of people who no nothing about forex trying to shove their lackluster courses down your throat? Then this is the perfect blog for you.</p>

<p>This blog will be focused on bringing you, the beginner (or maybe advanced) trader, to the next level, or at least teach you something new that will net you a couple extra pips. We here at IT focus on automation of the principles of NNFX in the backtesting and forward testing. We like our testing short, effective and of a significant sample size. This absolutely doesn’t mean you should be in a rush to set up your first forex account and then fail miserably cause you don’t know what you are doing. We want you to be as ready as possible by teaching you how to build a robust system from the ground up and test its effectivness in the live markets and finally, actually trade with it.</p>
<div id="requirements" />

<h2 id="what-do-i-need-to-knowhave-to-get-started">What do i need to know/have to get started?</h2>

<p>This blog is largely inspired by the NNFX way of trading. If you don’t know what that is, I would reccommend you visit the <a href="nnfx-beginner-vid">channel</a> and watch the content in the order reccommended by VP to get the gist of what’s going on here. I have to emphasize this, if you don’t understand the concept of NNFX and its goal, this blog will be effectively useless for you. <strong>This blog in its entirety is based on the teachings of VP</strong>.</p>

<p>Before you start reading this blog and applying its contents to your trading, you actually have to know learn and <strong>understand the concepts of forex as a whole</strong>. For this i would reccommend an excellent resource from babypips, the so-called <a href="school-of-pipsology">School of Pipsology</a>. This is what i used when i was beginner and knew almost nothing about forex.</p>

<p>Apart from the knowledge that’s required, you’re also going to need a PC and an internet connection. Sorry phone traders, this is the wrong place for you.</p>
