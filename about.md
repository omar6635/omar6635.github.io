# About the creator 

I'm an IT student based in germany with little coding experience under my belt. I've only taken part in a handful of school projects that were aimed at beginning programmers. Languages I know the basics of currently are:
 - python 
 - HTML, css
 - C++
 - C

I make up for the lack of experience by approaching Trading in a way that is contrarian and that, unlike the most out there, actually works, granted you put in the time and effort needed and apply my advice correctly.
